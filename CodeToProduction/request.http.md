A `request.http` file in a Node.js project is typically used for making HTTP requests directly from an IDE, such as VS Code or WebStorm. It helps developers test API endpoints without needing external tools like Postman or cURL.  

### **How It Works**
- The file contains raw HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- Requests can include headers, query parameters, and body content.
- IDE extensions, like **REST Client** in VS Code, can execute these requests.

### **Example of a `request.http` File**
```http
### Get all products
GET http://localhost:3000/api/products

### Get a single product by ID
GET http://localhost:3000/api/products/12345

### Create a new product
POST http://localhost:3000/api/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 1000,
  "category": "Electronics"
}

### Update a product
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/12345
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "price": 1200
}

### Delete a product
DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/products/12345
```

### **Why Use `request.http`?**
1. **Quick Testing**: Helps developers test API endpoints without running a frontend.
2. **Easy Collaboration**: Developers can share API test files within the repo.
3. **No External Tools Required**: Works inside VS Code with the **REST Client** extension.
