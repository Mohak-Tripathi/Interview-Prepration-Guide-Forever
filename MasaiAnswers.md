Masai School holds an indelible place in my heart, representing the pivotal foundation of my professional journey. In a nation where traditional degrees often dictate career paths, transitioning from a specialized field like law to software development seemed an insurmountable challenge. However, Masai's innovative approach to education made this leap not only possible but also seamless.

As a law graduate and practicing lawyer, I was acutely aware of the societal expectations and the rigidity associated with career transitions in India. The prospect of venturing into software development without an engineering background was daunting. Yet, in 2021, Masai emerged as a beacon of hope, offering a curriculum that emphasized practical skills over formal degrees.

The six-month tenure at Masai was transformative. The rigorous training, hands-on projects, and continuous mentorship equipped me with the technical proficiency and confidence required to excel in the tech industry. Beyond the technical skills, Masai instilled a growth mindset, teaching me the value of perseverance, adaptability, and continuous learning.

Reflecting on my journey, I consider myself fortunate to have discovered Masai. The institution not only provided me with the tools to redefine my career but also challenged societal norms, proving that with the right guidance and determination, one can transcend traditional boundaries. My gratitude towards Masai is profound, and its impact on my life is immeasurable. No matter where my career leads or the heights I achieve, Masai will always be the cornerstone of my professional narrative. 



**What Masai Means to Me**  

Masai holds a profound and irreplaceable place in my journey, not just as a stepping stone but as the foundation of my career transformation. It doesn't matter how far one advances in their career or the heights they achieve; what truly matters is where it all began. For me, Masai was that beginning.  

Coming from a background as a law graduate and a practicing lawyer, transitioning from such a highly specialized field to the world of software development seemed like an impossible task. In a country like India, where conventional beliefs about degrees often shape professional opportunities, it’s rare to imagine a career change without the conventional engineering path. But Masai School made the impossible possible.  

In 2021, Masai offered me the courage, structure, and guidance I needed to break through these barriers. The six months I spent there were transformative, not just in terms of acquiring technical skills but also in redefining how I approached challenges and opportunities. Masai’s rigorous curriculum, discipline-first approach, and unrelenting focus on practical, hands-on learning equipped me with the tools to thrive in a completely new domain.  

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have found Masai at a time when I was searching for a new direction in life. The lessons I learned—both technical and personal—continue to guide me to this day. I will always remain grateful for the opportunities, growth, and confidence Masai instilled in me.  

For me, Masai is more than just an institution—it’s a movement that empowers individuals to overcome societal and personal limitations, and for that, I will always hold it in the highest regard.

Masai holds a special place in my heart, not just as an institution but as a transformative chapter of my life. It represents the foundation of my journey into the world of software development—a journey that I once thought was beyond reach. No matter where my career takes me or what heights I achieve, I will always cherish and value where it all began, and for me, that beginning was Masai.  

As a law graduate and practicing lawyer, transitioning from a highly specialized field like law to software development in a country like India—where traditional degrees often define career paths—felt like an insurmountable challenge. In 2021, when I found Masai, it was more than just an opportunity; it was a turning point. The belief Masai had in my potential, despite my unconventional background, gave me the courage to believe in myself.  

The six months I spent at Masai were nothing short of transformative. The rigorous schedule, hands-on learning, and unwavering support from instructors and peers were instrumental in equipping me with not just technical skills but also the confidence to embrace a new identity as a software developer. It was more than a program—it was a journey of self-discovery and growth.  

Today, as I look back, I feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of Masai’s mission to empower individuals to rewrite their stories. Masai is not just where I learned to code; it’s where I learned to dream bigger, push my limits, and redefine what’s possible. For that, I will always remain deeply grateful.

If a mentee is struggling with motivation, my first step would be to actively listen to them with empathy and patience, ensuring they feel heard and valued. Often, the real reasons behind someone’s lack of motivation lie hidden beneath their words. Reading between the lines becomes crucial because, at times, individuals themselves may not fully understand what is holding them back.  

Having grown up in a culturally, regionally, and religiously diverse country like India, I have learned the value of listening to people’s unique stories and understanding their perspectives. This diversity has taught me that everyone’s journey is different, and there’s always something to learn from their experiences.  

Once I understand their challenges, I believe in offering an approach that is both inspirational and practical. Sharing examples from my own life—instances where I overcame similar struggles—can make the guidance more relatable and convincing. Breaking down their problems into manageable pieces and addressing them step by step is often an effective way to reduce their sense of overwhelm.  

Another key aspect is helping them reframe their perspective by making healthy comparisons. Gently reminding them that there are others who may face greater disadvantages yet continue to persevere can inspire hope and determination. However, this must be done with sensitivity, ensuring it uplifts rather than demotivates them.  

I also find that approaching them as a friend or an elder sibling, rather than strictly as a mentor, creates a safe space for open communication. Building this trust allows me to adapt my guidance based on the kind of motivation or inspiration they are most receptive to.  

Ultimately, my approach is rooted in emotional intelligence—a comprehensive and empathetic strategy tailored to their unique situation. Motivation is deeply personal, and I aim to meet them where they are, helping them rediscover their own strength and purpose.

Coming from a law background, I had been away from hard sciences and STEM subjects for five long years. Stepping back into this world and learning to code felt both daunting and exciting. The challenge wasn’t just about mastering technical concepts but also about shifting my mindset to embrace a completely different way of thinking and problem-solving.  

To be honest, Masai’s well-structured curriculum, rigorous pedagogy, and hands-on approach played a pivotal role in easing this transition. The consistent coding practice, the emphasis on building projects, and the disciplined schedule were instrumental in helping me bridge the gap. By simply trusting the process and following Masai’s framework, I saw tremendous improvement in my technical skills within those six transformative months.  

However, I’d be lying if I said the journey was without doubts. There were moments when I felt unsure of myself—questioning whether I could truly make this leap from law to software development. In those moments of uncertainty, I found immense support from my instructor associate, Pulkit Tyagi. His empathetic guidance, patience, and practical advice gave me the clarity and confidence I needed to tackle my weaknesses and grow into a well-rounded developer.  

Equally important were my peers at Masai. Their camaraderie, collaboration, and encouragement turned the challenges into shared experiences and made the journey not just manageable but deeply rewarding.  

Looking back, my time at Masai was nothing short of a rollercoaster—a mix of highs and lows, struggles and triumphs. But more than anything, it was a journey of growth and self-discovery. Today, I feel an immense sense of gratitude and fulfillment, knowing that those six months shaped the foundation of my career and reaffirmed my belief in perseverance and the power of community.

Helping a student struggling with soft skills like communication or teamwork is deeply personal to me because I’ve walked that path myself. Coming from a Hindi-medium background (UP Board), I initially faced significant challenges with English. Entering law school, I struggled with the basics of language—confusing “is” and “are,” “was” and “were.” The thought of standing up in a classroom or presenting before an audience left me frozen with fear. I vividly remember the chills and the overwhelming self-doubt during those moments.  

But those struggles became the foundation of my transformation. Over the years, with relentless effort and patience, soft skills became my core strength. I represented my college in debates, won moot court competitions, and worked alongside my seniors in trial courts and even the Delhi High Court. At Masai, I carried this growth forward, achieving one of the highest scores in LinkedIn, resume-building, and HR rounds combined. What seemed impossible at one point became my stronghold.  

I deeply understand the pain and challenges faced by those coming from regional language backgrounds. I know what it feels like to have stage fright and the fear of public speaking. That’s why I am determined to guide my mentees, ensuring they never face the same hurdles. I will provide actionable steps, practical exercises, and real-time conversational opportunities that helped me overcome those fears.  

As far as teamwork is concerned, I firmly believe no groundbreaking product is ever the work of a single individual. Collaboration and communication are non-negotiable in software engineering, and I ensure that my sessions are designed to be interactive, collaborative, and hands-on, enabling mentees to naturally develop these skills.  

As Mr. Yogesh once said, “Hard skills are easier to learn, but soft skills are harder to master.” Though the journey is challenging, I am committed to making it productive and shortening my mentees’ learning curve, ensuring they achieve results faster and with confidence.  







To improve the student journey and overall experience at Masai, I believe a holistic approach is necessary, focusing on technical skills, career guidance, personal development, and industry insights. With over 2.5 years of industry experience, I am confident that I can make a meaningful contribution in each of these areas:  

1. **Enhancing Technical Proficiency:**  
Having worked extensively as a software developer and now leading a four-member full-stack team on an AI-based product, I have gained deep insights into writing clean, scalable, and object-oriented code. I can assist students in overcoming their coding challenges, help them adopt best practices, and provide constructive feedback during code reviews. My goal would be to instill in them a mindset of crafting high-quality, production-ready code while nurturing problem-solving skills critical to software engineering.  

2. **Personalized Career Guidance:**  
As someone actively involved in hiring and building teams, I am keenly aware of current industry demands and emerging trends. I can guide students on how to align their skills with market needs, helping them navigate their career paths effectively. By moving beyond a “one-size-fits-all” approach, I can offer personalized advice tailored to their strengths and aspirations, ensuring they understand natural progressions in the tech field that resonate with their potential.  

3. **Building Soft Skills with Confidence:**  
Coming from a Hindi-medium background and transitioning into a successful career, I deeply understand the struggles of overcoming communication barriers. My journey from stage fright to excelling in debates, moot courts, and public speaking has given me invaluable insights into mastering soft skills. Having previously conducted sessions like the “Placed by Masai” initiative, I know how to help students articulate technical concepts with clarity and confidence, ensuring they stand out in interviews and the workplace.  

4. **Bridging the Gap with Industry Insights:**  
With my hands-on experience in AI and software development, I can share real-world examples and insights into how the industry is evolving. This can help students stay ahead of the curve by focusing on areas like AI, machine learning, and full-stack development, making them more market-ready.  

Masai has always been about empowering students to achieve their dreams. By integrating my technical expertise, career insights, and personal experiences, I aim to contribute meaningfully to their journey, ensuring their growth is well-rounded, impactful, and aligned with industry demands.
